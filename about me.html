        my name is Bethlehem Nigussie.I am Ethopian.my country is the most historical and multicultural place in the world.
        to know more about my country click the link below. <a href="ethiopia.html"> Ethiopia.com.</a>I graduated from University of Gondar with BSC degree in Health Informatics, August 2022. I have finished my course with GPA of 3.86 and was also recognized as a good student throughout elementary and high school.
        I have this intuition to learn new things also understand them, and I like exploring different places, cultures too.I think this allows a person to versatile to things one might encounter throughout our life.
        My future is related to programming. So I would like to attend your courses and be full stack web developer. As you said “the coming years are future of computers and AI” I would like to be part of future technology. I tried to learn in different sited but they are unorganized and I don’t know where I start from.
        I was able to acquire something about compute programming after joining department of health informatics; Due to the reason that health informatics being the combination of both health and computer science. During my stay in university I was able to see that things are evolving so in order to keep up we have to broaden our knowledge and understanding, so I keep getting intrigued by software systems and how they are able to minimize problems we face while doing our day to day activities 
        I suppose, I am a resilient person who would not let her break down because I face some bumps on the road of achieving my dreams. when I was in my second year, we face a chaotic moment in our country and was forced to return home for an unknown time and during that time most lost hope on the fuure but I could not do that to myself so I try educating myself as much as possible using some of the materials that were supplied by our teacher. I also believe I am a compassionate person, I always try to understand ones situation before judging them and try to help them in every way I can.
        I believe my road in life is just beginning so I am well prepared to face any type of challenge in the future to achieve my dreams and make the vision I have in to a reality. I plan to see myself in 10 years having web development and training institution in my country. If you want more contact me  <b>
